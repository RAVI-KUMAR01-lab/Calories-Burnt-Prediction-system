# Calories-Burnt-Prediction-system
This project implements a Calories Burnt Prediction system using Python and Supervised ML. The pipeline features Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, and EDA with Seaborn. Using the XGBRegressor algorithm, the model captures metabolic patterns with a high-accuracy MAE of 2.71. Optimized for Health-Tech, it excels in Predictive Modeling.
Performance was rigorously measured using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric, achieving a high-accuracy score of 2.71. This result indicates that the model's predictions deviate by less than three calories on average from the ground-truth data, demonstrating exceptional reliability. Ultimately, this project showcases advanced proficiency in Data Cleaning, Predictive Modeling, and Statistical Analysis, offering a production-ready approach to personalized health monitoring.
