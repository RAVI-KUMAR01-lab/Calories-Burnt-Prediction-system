# Calories-Burnt-Prediction-system
This project implements a Calories Burnt Prediction system using Python and Supervised ML. The pipeline features Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, and EDA with Seaborn. Using the XGBRegressor algorithm, the model captures metabolic patterns with a high-accuracy MAE of 2.71. Optimized for Health-Tech, it excels in Predictive Modeling.
